# Mechanistic Interpretability  Techniques (wip) 
Reproducible scaffolds for canonical mech-interp techniques—each subdir ships a  README outlining the paper findings to which the respective technique is attributed and  a `technique.py` potentially small tests on toy models. Does not include my personal twists that lives elsewhere.  

## TODO 
- [ ] Push first modules: information_decoding/, behavior_localization/, control_steering/ transformer/ maybe  implement decoder (nn, layers,tensors,optimizers..)  there
- [ ]  make mapping techniques → papers (from internal docs)
- [ ] Expand next: either .md files or the .py TBD t
